GMU Smash's Stream Updater Program ver .02

Created By:

	This program was made to update all of the text on the screen of OBS as long as OBS
is reading the text files it creates. The highlights button is a WIP.

TO RUN STREAMUPDATER:
you need Python's IDLE editor. Get it here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

As long as you have that everything should run just fine.
Don't remove it from its folder, otherwise it will not work.
